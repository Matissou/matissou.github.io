      <description>Few photos from Göteborg, Sweden Göteborg is the second biggest city in Sweden, with approxmatly half a million of citizens. It a humand sized city, with an archipelago and is more familial than Stockholm from my point of view. Their are many green places, like Botaniska garden (see photos), the natural reserve and all the garden accross the city. It&amp;rsquo;s not as much pricy as we could think ; food, transports and daily stuff (like coffee, beer &amp;hellip;) are like in France, but housing is really expensive and hard to find.</description>

      <description>Hello ! My name is Matisse and this is my first blog post on this website. It&amp;rsquo;s also a copy of what you can find on the home page of this website. The purpose of it is to present myself and what I will (possibly) write on this blog.
 Who are you ?
 I&amp;rsquo;m 21, studying computer science and bioinformatics. I love reading books, dev and debate. I run and play badminton sometimes, like son cubano, jazz and bossa nova music.</description>
